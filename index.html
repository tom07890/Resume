            <br>acquired the training for a role on the “check station” which involves 
            <br>checking all boxes that are flagged as having a potential problem, I 
            <br>check these boxes to ensure there are no problems with the items inside 
            <br>or the box itself. The main role is picking, a box comes on a line and I 
            <br>have to pick the correct part and quantity, labelling them. </p>

            <br>When packing I had to double check all parts are correct and packed 
            <br>in a way that they cannot be damaged during transit.</p>
